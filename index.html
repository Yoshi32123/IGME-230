    <p>
        Hi! My name is Kyler McQuillan and I am a 3rd year in the Game Design and Development major.  I enjoy playing Xbox with my friends (mainly Destiny), and playing soccer.  I hope I can become better at designing web interfaces by taking this class. This is my second year at RIT after transferring from two years at the University at Buffalo.  I hope one day that I'll be able to work for Bungie.
