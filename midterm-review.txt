    7) What does display:block do?
        - Stacks-up, top-over-bottom with other elements
        - Displays an element as a block element (like <p>). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width
        
    8) What does display:inline do?
        - Lines-up, side-by-side with other elements
        - Displays an element as an inline element (like <span>). Any height and width properties will have no effect
        
    9) What does display:inline-block do?
        - uses the "box model" and is only as wide as it needs to be
        - Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values
        
    10) What does display:flex do?
        - neighboring block elements line-up side-by-side with equal height
        - Displays an element as a block-level flex container
        
    11) what does float:left do?
        - The element floats to the left of its container
        
    12) Define inline, internal, and external style sheets.
        - inline: the style is added as an attribute to an HTML element within the document
        - internal/embedded: style rules are placed within a set of <style> tags in the <head> section of the document
        - external: the style rules are listed in a separate document. the CSS document "connects" to the HTML document through a link tag in the <head> section.
        
    13) If these 3 types of styles conflict, which one usually "wins"?
        - inline first, then embedded, then external
        
    14) Imagine we write a CSS rule that effects the color of elements in the <body> tag, which elements on the page will inherit the value of this property?
        - every element inside body. Usually includes h, p, and/or ol tags
        
    15) Which CSS properties are commonly NOT inherited?
        - borders, margins, padding
        
    16) How large is a CSS point unit?
        - one point is about 1/72 of an inch
        
    17) How large is a CSS pixel unit?
        - depends on the size of a pixel on the user's display. Could be 0.5" on mobile but will be 1" on desktop
        
    18) How large is an CSS em unit?
        - the size of the current font. 2em means 2 times the size of the current font
        
    19) How large is an CSS ex unit?
        - the lower-case x-height relative to that of the font
        
    20) Specify the CSS colors red, green, blue, black, and white in hexadecimal notation.
        - red: #ff0000
        - green: #00ff00
        - blue: #0000ff
        - black: #000000
        - white: #ffffff
        
    21) Why is it a good idea to specify more than 1 font name in your CSS font rules?
        - in case the user doesn't have a certain font.
        - font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Arial;  uses the first font that the user has
        
    24) Describe the CSS box model.
        - There is top, bottom, left, and right
        - margin is the space between the edge of the screen and the box
        - padding is the space between the edge of the box and where the text/images are located
        - height/width is the box size after margining.
        - border is the box edges between margin and padding
        - the elements are what is stored inside the margin (text/images)
        
    25) Describe the difference between margin and padding.
        - Margin is space that is "outside the box" and padding is space that is "inside the box"
        
    26) Give at least 3 properties of the "box" that we can set (other than margin and padding).
        - border, width, height
        
    27) What is the HTML tag used to connect to an external CSS file or an embedded font?
        - <link href="file location" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        
    28) What is the CSS property we use to define whether/how quickly a property will animate when changed?
