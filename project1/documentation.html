    <h4 class="subtitle">Overall Process:</h4>
    <p>Initial Design</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trying to figure out how to "fill" bloks was the first milestone. Using css classes, it made it very easy to implement.</li>
        <li>Implementing a "dragging" interface seemed too much work since the bloks were not pictures. Instead, it was changed to a move and place.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Errors that were overcame</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When moving the blok right or down, it would delete a portion of the blok. To fix this, a placement array was made before implementing the move.</li>
        <li>When moving to edge of the screen, it would cause indexing errors. To fix this, a min/max index was created/set based on the selected blok.</li>
        <li>Hovering over a filled cell with a selected cell would delete the filled cell. To fix this, a "filled and selected" class was made.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Notes:</h4>
    <p>This project was a lot of fun to make (and to play).</p>
    <p>The coding process was slightly expansive compared to other projects, but I couldn't keep myself away from it.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy playing it as much as everyone else!</p>
