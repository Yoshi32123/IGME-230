What went right:
    The implementation of the grids of bloks worked nicely. 
    The three "chooser" grids were perfectly created and worked just as planned from the beginning. 
    Swapping from "dragging" to just moving and placing worked much better and was much easier to implement.
    All of the bool checks being used work just as planned.

What went wrong:
    At first, cells were being deleted in multiple ways. Hovering over, moving right or down, and hitting the edge of the screen.
    Instructions was not being displayed properly until the folder location was swapped.
    Index restrictions was not working for the bloks until close to completing the project.

Future Improvements:
    An actual click and drag interface would be nice.
    Adding sounds and music would make for a better interface.

Teammate Contributions:
    I worked solo on this project. All credit is to me.

What my grade should be:
    With how much code I wrote for this project and the time I spent on it, I believe my grade should be a 100%.
    There are no bugs and it works exactly as planned.
    I even had friends playtest it to make sure it worked as planned, and they found bugs that I then fixed.
